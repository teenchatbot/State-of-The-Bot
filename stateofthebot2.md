## Notes from Reid
If you would like to write a State Of The Bot in any language, please contact me and I will
arrange it.

## General Things
Phoibe was released completely open source for everyone, if you would like to support the project
there is a patreon that you may donate to.
### Versions
Everything was upgraded to 2.0.2 Hephestus, yay, it's all open source for everyone
### Known Issues
Getting setup on Ubuntu computers gives an error about profiles with selenium, the reccomended
specs are still 8GB of RAM and Arch Linux. Reading links may sometimes give an error, just restart the bot
it's being looked into and should be fixed soon.
### API Usage
It's the same as before, only DeepL, API keys should be free for the size of these rooms.
### Security Issues
No known security issues

As always Thank you from everyone from TeamShadowz for reading this edition of State Of The Bot and using phoibe
