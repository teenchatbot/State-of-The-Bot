## Notes from Reid
Welcome ladies and gentleman to the first ever edition of State of The Bot, from now on this is going to tell you all the juicy news and
technical stuff about what's happening behind the scenes on the development of the bot. Please note that this not a changelog, if you want that just view the git commit history smh. Alright, lets get started.

## General Things
As this is the first edition, note that the bot has been released (duh). From now on whenever I mention the bot I will be talking about the
private version that is available for room owners, if I have something to say about the pubicly available version, I will explicitly say so.
### Versions
The public version is still on version 1.5.1, it's going to stay this way until the team and I can get the other version to a point where we
feel that the gap between the two is significant enough to update phoibe-public to version 2.0.0. On that note; phoibe is on version 2.0.2, an update is expected soon. Please note that the release version is still on 2.0.1, this includes the .exe files.
### Known Issues
The message reading is kind of slow, this is due to a bug that was found when voting that would cause the bot to crash when sending the results of the election, if you have voting turned off this should not affect you, but as always if you have a bug please open an issue at
https://github.com/teenchatbot/Bot-Issues
### API Usage
The only APIs that are in use right now is the deepl API for translating text, if you have translations turned off then you should be fine.
### Security Issues
There are no known security issues

Thank you taking the time to read this edition of State of The Bot, from everyone at TeamShadowz we thank you
